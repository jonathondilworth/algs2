General implementations of models from the advanced algorithms two module (UoM).

I have also decided that this README file is where I'm going to be doing my revision, so I'm going to to slapping any notes in here. Additional notes on implementations may be found at the following:
 - jonathondilworth.me
 - jonathondilworth.blogspot.com

Currently contains:
 - An implementation for the generation of the ER Random, complex network model.
 - Hopefully I won't forget to add more here when I actually commit other code.. (I am only human!)
